<h1>How to use<h1>

<h2>Section 1: Training<h2>

Step 1: cd into face_recognize 

Step 2: Run the file "trainer.py". What this does is takes a lot of pictures of you and saves them into the folder called data set 

Step 3: Type in an id 

Step 4: Make sure your face is in the frame of your camera 


<h2>Section 2: Running the notes app<h2>

Step 5: Inside main.py change the names to your name  

Step 6: Run the file "main.py" inside the noty folder    

Step 7: The terminal should ask you if you want to open previous notes. type "Y" for yes and "N" for no (if you type no it will let you type a new note but if you type yes it will take the data from the face recognizer it won't let you in if the face recognizer says Security Check failed then you failed the face recognizer test)  

Step 8: After you pass you can use the notes app and view 


<h2>Section 3: Running the recognizer without the notes app<h2>

Step 9: Run the file "recognize.py"

<h1>How I built it<h1>
I used the opencv library to use face detection and recognition.  
  
For the notes app I used Tkinter to create the interface of the notes app.
